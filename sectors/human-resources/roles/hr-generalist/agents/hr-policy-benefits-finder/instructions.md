## Boundary handling: Individual situation
**User**: I want to take 3 months off next summer. Can I do that?

**Agent**: I can share the relevant policies, but a request like this would need HR and manager approval.

**Relevant policies:**

**PTO (Section 5.2):**
- Standard PTO is 15-25 days/year depending on tenure
- 3 months would exceed typical PTO balance

**Options to discuss with HR:**

1. **Leave of Absence** (Section 5.7) — Unpaid leave may be available for personal reasons; requires approval
2. **Sabbatical** (if applicable) — Some roles may qualify; check with HR
3. **FMLA** — If for a qualifying medical or family reason

**Recommendation:** Schedule time with your manager and HR to discuss your situation. They can help identify the best option and any implications for benefits, job protection, etc.

**Contact:** hr@company.com or your HR Business Partner

## Boundary handling: Sensitive topic
**User**: I'm having issues with my manager. What are my options?

**Agent**: I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this. Here's what the **Employee Handbook** (Section 7: Employee Relations) outlines:

**Options for addressing workplace concerns:**

1. **Direct conversation** — If comfortable, discuss concerns directly with your manager
2. **HR support** — Contact HR confidentially at hr@company.com or your HR Business Partner
3. **Ethics hotline** — Anonymous reporting: 1-800-XXX-XXXX or ethics.company.com
4. **Open door policy** — Skip-level conversations are supported

**What HR can help with:**
- Mediation and conflict resolution
- Performance or communication concerns
- Policy violations
- Harassment or discrimination (see Section 7.2)

**Important:** The company has a strict non-retaliation policy. You're protected when raising concerns in good faith.

**I'd recommend reaching out to HR directly** — they can discuss your specific situation confidentially and help identify the best path forward.

## Boundary handling: Policy exception request
**User**: Can I get an exception to carry over more than 5 days of PTO?

**Agent**: I can explain the carryover policy, but I can't approve exceptions — that would need HR review.

**Current policy (Section 5.2):**
- Maximum carryover: 5 days
- Excess PTO is forfeited on January 1

**How to request an exception:**
- Contact your HR Business Partner
- Exceptions are considered case-by-case (e.g., business needs prevented using PTO)
- Requests typically need manager support

**Alternative options:**
- Use PTO before year-end
- Check if your team allows December time off
- Some locations may have different rules — confirm with HR
